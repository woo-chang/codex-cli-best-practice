## Settings Hierarchy

Settings apply in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

| Priority | Location | Scope | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | CLI flags / `-c key=value` | Invocation | One-off overrides for a single run |
| 2 | `.codex/config.toml` | Project | Team-shared defaults, profiles, MCP, agents |
| 3 | `~/.codex/config.toml` | Global | Personal defaults across projects |

## Core Configuration

```toml
# .codex/config.toml
model = "o4-mini"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
approval_policy = "on-request"
```

## Profiles

Named presets under `[profiles.<name>]` — switch with `codex --profile <name>`:

```toml
[profiles.conservative]
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
approval_policy = "untrusted"

[profiles.development]
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
approval_policy = "on-request"

[profiles.ci]
model = "o4-mini"
sandbox_mode = "read-only"
approval_policy = "never"

[profiles.trusted]
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
approval_policy = "never"
```

Set a default profile with `profile = "conservative"` at the top level.

## Sandbox Modes

| Mode | File Access | Network | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read-only` | Read-only project access | Blocked | Reviews, audits, CI analysis |
| `workspace-write` | Read/write inside the workspace | Blocked | Local development and doc/code edits |
| `danger-full-access` | Unrestricted filesystem access | Allowed | Fully trusted automation that needs network or installs |

## Approval Policies

| Policy | Behavior | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `untrusted` | Auto-runs only trusted read-style commands; asks for the rest | New repos, audits, reviews |
| `on-request` | Model decides when it should ask | Everyday development |
| `never` | Never asks; failures come straight back to the model | Non-interactive runs and tightly controlled automation |

## Override

Use `AGENTS.override.md` for personal instruction overrides — loaded before `AGENTS.md`, not committed to git.

## MCP Servers

Declare shared integrations in the same config file:

```toml
[mcp_servers.github]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
env = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "$GITHUB_TOKEN" }
```

## Agents

Register agents under `[agents.<name>]` and optionally point them at dedicated role files:

```toml
[agents.backend-dev]
description = "Handles backend implementation tasks"
config_file = "agents/backend-dev.toml"
```

## One-Off Overrides

```bash
codex -c model=\"o3\" -c approval_policy=\"never\" exec "summarize this diff"
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Using `danger-full-access` for ordinary editing tasks
- Treating `never` as a general-purpose local default
- Using `danger-full-access` and `never` together without a real containment boundary
- Hardcoding secrets instead of using `$ENV_VAR` expansion
- Mixing unrelated concerns into one profile instead of creating focused profiles
